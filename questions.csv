"Structure determination","In1H NMR Spectroscopy what does the splittin pattern tell us?","The number of adjacent, non-equivalent protons according to the n + 1 rule"
"Structure determination","In NMR Spectroscopy what does the number of peaks relate to?","The number of different environments"
"Structure determination","In NMR Spectroscopy what the chemical shift tell us?","The molecular environment"
"Structure determination","What is the n + 1 rule?","It gives the number of peaks into which the signal of the neighbouring envionment will be split"
"Structure determination","What is TMS?","Tetramethylsilane. Its used as the standard for NMR Spectroscopy and its peak is set to zero on the chemical shift scale"
"Structure determination","Why are the advantages of TMS?","Volatile, inert, it has signals that are well to the right of the majority fo the peaks in organic chemistry and it has one environment"
"Structure determination","Why is deuterated trichloromethane used as the solvent in1H NMR spectroscopy (instead of undeuterated trichloromethane)?","Deuterium is not NMR active and therefore doesn’t show up on the spectrum - it is still used in13C but the peak can removed by the computer software"
"Chromatography","Describe CC.","A column is packed with a solid (silica) and a solvent moves down the column"
"Chromatography","Describe GC.","A column is packed with a solid or with a solid coated by a liquid, and an inert gas is passed through the column under pressure at high temperature"
"Chromatography","Describe TLC.","A plate is coated with a solid (silica on a plastic plate) and a solvent moves up the plate"
"Chromatography","In GC, what is the retention time?","The time taken for the substances to be eluted"
"Chromatography","What are the general names given to the phases in chromatography?","Stationary and mobile"
"Chromatography","What does CC stand for?","Column Chromatography"
"Chromatography","What does GC stand for?","Gas Chromatography"
"Chromatography","What does TLC stand for?","Thin Layer Chromatography"
"Chromatography","What is chromatography?","A process to separate the constituents of a mixture (usually coloured dyes at iGCSE) - separation depends on the balance between solubility in the mobile phase and the retention by the stationary phase"
"Chromatography","What is the Rfvalue and how is it calculated?","Retention factor = (distance moved by the component of a solute)/(distance moved by the solvent)"
"Transition Metals","Define bidentate ligand","A ligand which can donate two lone pairs of electrons to form two coordinate bonds with the central metal ion"
"Transition Metals","Define complex","A central metal ion surrounded by ligands"
"Transition Metals","Define coordinate (dative covalent) bond.","An electrostatic foce of attracion between the shared pair of electrons and the nuclei of the atoms invovled where both elctrons are from the same atom."
"Transition Metals","Define coordination number.","the number of dative covalent bonds formed to a central metal ion in a complex"
"Transition Metals","Define ligand.","A molecule or ion which can donate one or more lone pairs of electrons to form coordinate (date covalent) bond(s) with a central metal ion in a complex"
"Transition Metals","Define monodentate ligand.","A ligand which can donate one lone pair of electrons to form one coordinate bond with the central metal ion"
"Transition Metals","Define multidentate ligand","A ligand which can donate multiple lone pairs of electrons to form multiple coordinate bonds with the central metal ion"
"Transition Metals","In general, what is a d-block element?","An element whose outermost electron is in a d orbital"
"Transition Metals","In general, what is a ligand substitution reaction?","A reaction in which one or more ligands is/are repalced by one or more different ligands in a complex"
"Transition Metals","In general, what is a transition element?","An element which has at least one stable ion with a partially filled d-orbital"
"Transition Metals","In general, what is the chelate effect?","When several unidentate ligands are replaced by multidentate ligands in a complex."
